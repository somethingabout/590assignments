### How to get the data

Read in with tidytuesdayR package 

Install from CRAN via: 
```{r}
install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
```

This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-12-07')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 50)
spiders <- tuesdata$spiders
```

Or read in the data manually

```{r}
spiders <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-07/spiders.csv')

```
